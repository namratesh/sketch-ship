"""Gemini vision jobs: asset fingerprinting + leak comparison (IMPLEMENTATION.md §3.4-3.5, §3.7).

Every call is wrapped in try/except with a canned fallback so a network
hiccup / rate limit during the live demo never crashes the request. We
log clearly to console whether the LIVE Gemini path or the FALLBACK path
was used, so it's obvious during rehearsal / grading which one ran.
